Here we show how to de-noise matter fields as described in "De-noising non-Gaussian fields in cosmology with normalizing flows."

The notebooks load pre-trained flows for either periodic and non-periodic data in pretrained_flows directory.

The notebooks run on the samples of 100 maps of test data for periodic and non-periodic maps in sample_test_data directory.
