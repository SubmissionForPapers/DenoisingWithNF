Here we show how to de-noise matter fields as described in "De-noising non-Gaussian fields in cosmology with normalizing flows."

The notebooks load pre-trained flows for either periodic or non-periodic data in pretrained_flows directory.

 Wiener filtering requires the power spectrum coefficients of the maps, which are provided in sample_test_data directory.

Requirements: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PyTorch (we use version 1.11.0), imageio, Pk_library
